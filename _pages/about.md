I am Mani Sazvar. I'm studying computer engineering in Iran University of science and technology. 
I'm a GEEK and I love computers. since I was in seventh grade, I have been programming. 
Also I play piano in my free time. It turns out that I also love classical music.
Every day I try to  level up my skills and be a better person.
That was all you need to know about me!
