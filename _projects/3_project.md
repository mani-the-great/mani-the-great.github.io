I made a windows game called "the snake and ladder". It is a simple game but it will amuse you. each time you click on the dice and the program will randomly give you a number from 1 to 6 that will determine your next step in the game.
Also my brother helped me to create this program. He created the snake images and I used those images to create the app.
I also included an exiting song so you will not get tired while playing this amazing game. I hope you enjoy the game!
